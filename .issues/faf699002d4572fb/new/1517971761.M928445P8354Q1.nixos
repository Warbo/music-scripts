Subject: Avoid lots of long-lived dbus-daemon processes
Message-Id: <faf699002d4572fb-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

Just spotted that my laptop is running about 250 'dbus-daemon'
processes, which I presume are due to 'ff' using 'dbus-launch'.

Perhaps there is an alternative, e.g. see the discussion on:
