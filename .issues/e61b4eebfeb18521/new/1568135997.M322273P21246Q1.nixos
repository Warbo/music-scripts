Subject: Don't suggest colons in album directory names
Message-Id: <e61b4eebfeb18521-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

When we suggest that a directory is renamed to match an album, replace any
colons with " - ".

We should also do this when looking for matches, since " - " should be
acceptable in place of ':'.
