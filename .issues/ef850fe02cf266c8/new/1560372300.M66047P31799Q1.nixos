Subject: Use discogs as fallback if metal-archives don't work
Message-Id: <ef850fe02cf266c8-0-artemis@nixos>

metal-archives only work for metal bands; discogs should be more
general, but will also have more ambiguity. We should try metal-archives
first, but discogs as a backup.

We should also allow override URLs to be given in a hidden file, so we
can associate a directory with a known artist URL.
