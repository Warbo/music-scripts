Subject: Investigate replacing git2html with stagit
Message-Id: <c34ae5bb8290653c-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

Output looks prettier, can make an index page (rather than using the
directory listing for /git like we do at the moment), seems faster
(written in C) and uses less space (e.g. only HEAD gets a file tree).
