Message-Id: <c7f5325b483bc746-0-artemis@nixos>

Now that we have a "landing page" for each repo, git2html can focus on
just the branches/commits/etc.

Compare our changes to the upstream version, since most of the work here
will just involve putting things back how they were (keep the `head -n1`
stuff though)
