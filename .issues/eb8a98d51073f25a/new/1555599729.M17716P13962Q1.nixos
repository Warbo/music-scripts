Subject: Split tests up into separate files
Message-Id: <eb8a98d51073f25a-0-artemis@nixos>

We should make files like tests/foo.nix and have tests/default.nix load
them all.

We can do this with the nixFilesIn from nix-helpers. We can also use
removeAttrs or filter to prevent loading default.nix or testData.nix.
