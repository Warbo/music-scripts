Subject: Only strip youtube crap from basenames
Message-Id: <fd6893323e5c5db2-0-artemis@nixos>

When we try removing youtube IDs by dropping whatever's after a hyphen, we can
end up spotting hyphens in directory names. That's nonsense, we should only be
looking in the basename.

While we're at it, we should see how many characters are in a youtube ID, so
that we check for that many.
