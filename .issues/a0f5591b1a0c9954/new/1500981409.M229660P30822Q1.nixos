Subject: Fix HTML escaping when rendering README
Message-Id: <a0f5591b1a0c9954-0-artemis@nixos>

In particular, code blocks containing `import <nixpkgs> {}` become
`import <lt;nixpkgs>gt; {}`.

Also, the README is preceded by "Contents of follows", which should be
the filename (e.g. "Contents of README follows" or "Contents of
README.md follows")
