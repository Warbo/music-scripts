Subject: Don't suggest leading dots when moving tracks into albums
Message-Id: <9ef999b86b5cb9d1-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

If a track's album is "...And Justice for All" we should suggest moving
it to "And Justice for All/", since leading dots would cause it to be
hidden.

We should also treat non-dotted folders as matches when checking.
