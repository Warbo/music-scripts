Subject: Fix youtube-dl getting video instead of audio
Message-Id: <f14eb157800547e8-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

In get_album.sh we're getting video files instead of audio. Probably a
change in youtube-dl options.

Also, don't do the tmp_* stuff; just use set_tag to tag the artist and
album.
