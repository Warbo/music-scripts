Subject: Set filenames in iget
Message-Id: <d9eec4c00e8d7244-0-artemis@nixos>

get_iplayer has changed recently, and now saves files with unhelpful
programme IDs as their filename.

Since we tend to use iget rather than calling get_iplayer directly, and
we tend to give it a URL, we should automatically rename the result
using the last component of the URL.
