Used to navigate the verbose output of Drupal's SimpleTest module.

SimpleTest verbose output files have names of the form "TestCaseName-n.html"
where "n" is a counter. Each page starts with a header, containing details of
the request as well as previous/next links. Annoyingly, these links are:
 - Preceded by the counter, so their position changes when the number of
   digits in the counter changes.
 - Displayed in a variable-width font.
 - Occluded by modal crap (ie. "light boxes").
 - Scrollable off the screen.
 - Designed to be used with a mouse.

This all contributes to making navigation a pain, hence this extension.

Usage:

Ctrl-Left will navigate to the previous page
Ctrl-Right will navigate to the next page

Easy.
